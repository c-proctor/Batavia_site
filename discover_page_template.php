Matham of Haarlem, shows the Waterpoort or sea-gate of the castle incomplete, with scaffolding and a ladder in the place of an actual gateway.</p>

                    <p>On the 28 October, 1628 the VOC (Dutch East India Company) ship Batavia left Texel in The Netherlands bound for Batavia, the company's headquarters in the East. The ship was under the command of Francisco Pelsaert and was carrying about 300 passengers, including women and children.<br><br>Because of a personal grievance against Pelsaert, the Master, Adrian Jacobz, together with the Supercargo, Jeronimus Cornelisz, plotted a mutiny. Their plan was to slip away from the fleet after leaving the Cape of Good Hope, seize the Batavia and then pirate other richly laden ships bound for the Indies.</p>
